## Info/About

- Gen 2 is my favorite Pokémon game in so many ways and after finding Pokémon Heart & Soul and all it had to offer, it gave me the push to try making my own QoL features, changes, and additions that would make it my ideal Pokémon game. My goal for this repository is to make branches that are compatible with the [main](https://github.com/PokemonHnS-Development/pokemonHnS) branch of Pokémon Heart & Soul to allow other devs to take these branches and implement them hopefully easily.

- My `main` branch will contain changes so that my machine can compile (use `make modern`) and this document. I will attempt to keep my various branches up to date with my `main` so this document is updated with any changes when viewing those branches.

- The `build` branch will be the branch where I combine all my other branches to make a version with all my changes/additions.

- Occasionally, I may combine branches into groups of changes that are all similar in nature, merge branches into one - leaving the merged branch(es) as standalone - that I think would benefit from my other changes, or delete branches that have been merged into a grouping to keep things clean.

- I will probably have releases of my full build as I continue adding things, and possibly patch files for some of the changes/groups that I have made.

- Some branches will have screenshots in the `docs` folder if you wanted to see how a feature looked in game.

- Have any questions or notice any issues, please open an issue or I can be found on the Pokemon Heart & Soul Discord.

## Changes/Features/Additions

- Bug fixes from pokemonHnS branches cause I don't want to play with bugs if I don't have to. (collection of cherry-picked commits)

- Infinite Repel Nuzlocke Setting (AFFECTS SAVE DATA)

- BST Viewer in Summary Page
  - View BST breakdown by pressing START on the Stats Summary screen
  - New window for BST value added under EXP

- BST Distribution Randomizer Setting (AFFECTS SAVE DATA)
  - Note: Recommend `BST Viewer` feature as well

- Pokédex shortcuts
  - Party Menu's selection submenu
  - Info Summary screen (This means it can also be accessed when inspecting a Pokémon in the PC)

- Key Item DexNav that spits out the wild Pokêmon in the area
  - I gotta add "&"s to the lists cause its driving me nuts
  - Might implement a full UI based on [this DexNav UI](https://github.com/ghoulslash/pokeemerald/tree/dexnav).

- Field Moves submenu in party menu's selection menu (removes the limit on 4 usable field moves on a Pokémon)
  - **I also changed the logic on how the Challenge/Randomizer HM Override setting determines when to show FLY or FLASH in a Pokémon's FIELD MOVES. It now checks if the player has the HM in their bag for all slots in the party (the leading pokemon will still show FLY/FLASH regardless and non-leading slots will have a check for if they can learn it, due to how the original HM Override works)**
 
- PokeGear UI Update
  - Changed the PokeGear's Main Menu UI to be more aligned with a PokeGear (HGSS, gen4) rather than a PokeNav (RSE, gen3).
  - A blue color is currently implemented, but the files for a yellow version are also present (just rename the file(s) for the desired color to be the proper name used by the game - be sure to store the previous if you want to keep both options in the files).
 
- Option Menu Setting for Disabling Nickname Prompt (AFFECTS SAVE DATA)
  - In the branch I also included a new string after the player catches Pokêmon that spits out "{POKEMON} added to {PLAYER}'s party." - similar to how the "sent to PC" message is displayed.
  - I also added Nuzlocke Forced Naming logic to Anorith when received from the fossil guy. The other 4 fossils had it, so it just got missed.
 
- Show move power for Return/Frustration in Summary screen

- A key item wheel (Touches saveblock, but uses some unused sections so that compatability is kept I believe)
  - Brings the Select-Tap option to have 4 options instead of 1.
  - Kept the Select-Hold functionality present in HnS.
  - [Original implementation - PokeCommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/oras-style-key-item-wheel.498877/)

- Mom's Savings
  - Implemented Mom's savings feature that wasn't originally in pokemonHnS. I tried to follow GSC & HGSS for how it worked in both games. The one-time rewards are a mishmash of both Gen2's and Gen4's (with a masterball on the end of the list) it will be changed to pokédolls once pokemonHnS has enabled them again (to reflect how she gave you dolls in Gen 2). After the sequential gifts she will give the player berries that can be used at Kurt's to create Pokéballs.
  - Auto savings prompt during intro.
  - 25% of battle winnings are sent to Mom if auto savings is enabled.
  - Multichoice menu when talking with Mom to check balance, deposit, withdraw, and toggle auto savings.
 
- Pokémon Party on Load Save Window
  - Added animated icons on the Load Save screen when the user starts the game (uses the party menu's implementation of the icons as a reference)
 
- Move Relearner Shortcut from Summary Screen
  - Added a shortcut to the Summary screen's Battle/Contest moves screen that opens up an extended Move Relearner menu that includes moves from the following lists: learnset, egg moves, tutor moves, & the compatible TM/HMs in the player's bag.
  - I didn't touch the actual move relearner NPC's functionality - he still takes a heart scale and only teaches learnset moves. 

## Programs used:
- VS Code
- Tilemap Studio (For assigning tilesets to a tilemap)
- Libresprite (For editing sprites & tilesets)

If you find any issues with my feature branches, please let me know and I can get the bug/issue resolved!

Thanks for reading & enjoy, Skel
